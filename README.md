# Custom Needolin
Partially inspired by Custom Knight, this mod makes it
possible to replace the sound clip of the Needolin 
with a custom audio file.

To add an audio file, go to the mod's folder on your 
machine and open the audio folder. You can then copy 
your desired audio file (.WAV format) into the folder 
alongside the existing files. 

Once your desired file is in the audio folder, open 
the Bepinex menu (F1), go to CustomNeedolin, and type 
the file's name into the Audio File field without the 
file extension. For example, to play Sakura by 
Zambolino, enter "Zambolino - Sakura" into the field.

## Warnings
This mod does not currently mute or overwrite the audio played by
the Spider Strings tool.
